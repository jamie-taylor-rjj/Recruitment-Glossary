## 10,000 ft Overview

Mono is a reimplementation of .NET Framework, written entirely in C++. It was created by a team of developers lead by [Miguel de Icaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Icaza) as .NET Framework only ran on Windows. The goal for Mono was to make an unofficial platform agnostic .NET Runtime.

The work done by de Icaza and the rest of the time directly lead to the creation of [Xamarin]({{< relref "what-is-xamarin" >}}), .NET Core (and modern .NET), [Blazor]({{< relref "what-is-blazor" >}}), and [.NET MAUI]({{< relref "what-is-maui" >}}).
