## 10,000 ft Overview

Xamarin was a technology created by a team of developers lead by [Miguel de Icaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Icaza). It used the [Mono runtime]({{< relref "what-is-mono" >}}) in order to build applications for iOS and Android.

This was an important innovation, as it allowed developers to use both [.NET]({{< relref "what-is-net" >}}) and [C#]({{< relref "what-is-c-sharp" >}}) (pronounced "C Sharp") to build mobile applications; allowing them to have a single code base, in a common language, rather than separate code bases for iOS (using Swift) and Android (using either Java or Kotlin).
