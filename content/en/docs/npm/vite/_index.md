Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of a dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules and a build command that bundles your code with Rollup.

Vite leverages browser-native ES modules to provide lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and instant server start, making it an excellent choice for modern frontend development.
