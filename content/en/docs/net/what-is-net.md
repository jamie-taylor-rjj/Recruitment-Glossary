## 10,000 ft Overview

.NET is a term used to describe a number of different technologies, all owned and maintained ny Microsoft. These technologies include (but are not limited to):

- .NET Framework
- .NET Core
- .NET (aka modern .NET)
- Xamarin (docs page coming soon)
- Mono (docs page coming soon)
- Blazor (docs page coming soon)
- .NET MAUI (docs page coming soon)
- SignalR (docs page coming soon)
- WPF (docs page coming soon)

## Beginner Information

.NET can usually mean either .NET Framework (a technology for building applications for Windows-only), .NET Core, or .NET 5+ (for building applcations on Windows, MacOS, or some [Linux distributions]({{< relref  "what-is-linux" >}})). The history of .NET gets a little confusing, because it was almost always referred to as ".NET", even before the more modern .NET was released.

.NET Framework was originally released in 2002, and .NET Core was originally released in 2016. In November 2020, .NET Core was renamed to .NET for the .NET 5 release; going forward, ".NET" will refer to the cross-platform variant and ".NET Framework" refer to the Windows-only variant. Some developers in the .NET community refer to all versions after 5 as "Modern .NET".

There were originally two officially supported programming languages for use with .NET:

- VB .NET
- [C#]({{< relref "what-is-c-sharp" >}}) (pronounced "C Sharp")

However, in recent years VB .NET support has been quietly dropped, and [F#]({{< relref "what-is-f-sharp" >}}) (pronounced "F Sharp") support has been added in it's place.

## Intermediary Information

.NET Core (now know as ".NET") started life as a combination of an open-source re-write of .NET Framework and the Mono runtime. Mono was created as a one-to-one binary equivalent runtime for .NET Framework applications, but was cross-platform.

Xamarin was created as a way to build and run applications for Android and iOS (both are Unix-like operating systems), using XAML-like syntax to describe the user interface. When Microsoft bought Xamarin, they started work on better tooling for Xamarin, and started converting the Mono runtime to [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/) such that it could be run in the browser; this created the Blazor project.

There was no official way to build GUI-based when .NET Core was first released (whereas .NET Framework has WinForms, WPF, UWP, and WinUI). But shortly after the release of .NET 6, Microsoft released .NET MAUI, which is the next evolution of Xamarin Forms. This allows developers to build GUI-based applications for .NET and run them on:

- Windows
- Android
- iOS
- MacOS
- Web
- Tizen
