## 10,000 ft Overview

SignalR is a .NET library which allows developers of ASP .NET and ASP .NET Core applications to create real-time communications between the browser and a web server without having to perform a full page refresh. This allows the server to push code to the browser at a stage after the page has rendered without having to request it using AJAX (for instance).
