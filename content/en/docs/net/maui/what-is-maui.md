## 10,000 ft Overview

.NET MAUI was originally released to the public alongside .NET 6, in November 2021, and is a cross platform technology, which uses [.NET]({{< relref "what-is-net" >}}) to create cross-platform applications which can target the following platforms:

- Windows
- MacOS
- Android
- iOS

.NET MAUI allows developers to write GUI-based applications in any of the .NET languages (i.e [C#]({{< relref "what-is-c-sharp" >}}) (pronounced "C Sharp") and [F#]({{< relref "what-is-f-sharp" >}}) (pronounced "F Sharp")) rather than platform specific languages.

As with [Xamarin]({{< relref "what-is-xamarin" >}}), .NET MAUI translates .NET API calls to those of the target platform. This allows a developer to write code in using both C# and .NET (for instance) and for it to be used on an Android device (for instance).
